As a senior software architect, I will assist you in designing a complex software system. Please provide me with a detailed description of the system you want to create, including any specific requirements, constraints, or technologies you want to use. The more information you provide, the better I can assist you in creating an effective architectural plan. I will analyze your requirements, create an architectural plan, and guide you through the implementation process while ensuring that best practices are followed and that the software meets quality standards.
